# _Phone Zone - Online Smartphones Store_
It's no secret that during the COVID-19 pandemic the shopping world changed, and most of the regular stores moved online.
Due to this change, I've decided to build an online smartphones store and this is the result:

Phone Zone is a modern and fully responsive online e-commerce store, inspired by some real online stores and allows you to "order" smartphones and mobile accessories. As a Frontend Developer, it was important to me to focus on creating an easy and intuitive user interface with a clean and modern design. For the avoidance of doubt, this is just a personal project and I don't sell anything.

In the Frontend, I've been using React with Material-UI framework and SASS. In the Backend, I've been using Stripe for the payment system and Commerce.JS, a service that allows managing the Backend part of stores like that: Store the products and their information, determine shipping countries and subdivisions prices and managing orders in an easy way.
